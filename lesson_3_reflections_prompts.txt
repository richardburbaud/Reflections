  When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If we have several people working on the project
If I need to work on the project from several computers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Some other people may be pushing code to the remote
If I pull this code automatically this may interact with what I'm writing
even if I'm not ready

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is a copy in github of an online repo, may not exist on my computer
Clone is a copy of a github repo onto my computer
Branch is a variation of code created to isolate a wip

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Can be useful if we want to understand the changes that have been done
before merging into what I have done on my side

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?
What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Collaborating would be hard without github
we would overwrite each others work without knowing
Branching and creating good PR without git would be very difficult
