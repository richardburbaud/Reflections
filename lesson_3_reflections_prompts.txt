  When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If we have several people working on the project
If I need to work on the project from several computers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Some other people may be pushing code to the remote
If I pull this code automatically this may interact with what I'm writing
even if I'm not ready
